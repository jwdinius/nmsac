This subproject implements a convex relaxation of the binary optimization problem discussed in this [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.910&rep=rep1&type=pdf), Section 5.4.  For more details, check out some of these resources:

* Mathematical details: [Part 1](https://jwdinius.github.io/blog/2019/point-match/) and [Part 2](https://jwdinius.github.io/blog/2019/point-match-cont/)
* [Code design notes](https://jwdinius.github.io/blog/2019/point-match-sol/)

_Note: this algorithm is pretty slow, but is provided as a reference implementation for benchmarking and to demonstrate desired project structure._
